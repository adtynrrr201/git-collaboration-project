## ✍️ Commit Message Guidelines

Follow these guidelines for writing commit messages:

- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line
- Capitalize the first letter of the subject line
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line (for longer commits)
